# OptionAnalytics - notes for every session

## The strategy scanner is the most important part of the app

The Order Flow page's strategy scanner (`optionanalytics.client/src/strategyEngine.js`,
`StrategyScanner.jsx`, `scannerCore.js`, fed by `useDayOi.js`, `liveFeeds.js`, `orderFlowMath.js`, `profiles.js`, `suddenOi.js` and `dayRegime.js`) decides when a trade
is signalled, at what entry, stop-loss and target, how a trailing stop moves, when a trade exits and
what the paper / live option trade does. A mistake there costs real money.

After ANY change to those files (or to anything they read):

```
cd optionanalytics.client
npm test          # node --test: every strategy's scenarios, the outcome rules, no look-ahead
npm run lint
npx vite build
```

All must pass before committing. The SAME scanner also runs on the server for NIFTY, BANKNIFTY and SENSEX
(`optionanalytics.client/scanner-runner/`, bundled by `npm run build:runner`, started by the server's
`ScannerRunnerHostedService`): the page and the runner share `scannerCore.js` / `liveFeeds.js`, so a change
there changes both - `tests/scanner-core.test.mjs` and `tests/scanner-runner.test.mjs` cover them. The runner is
paper only: its "Runner" role cannot reach the live-trading API.

When adding or changing a strategy:

- add a scenario test in `optionanalytics.client/tests/` - it fires on its rules (LONG and SHORT where
  it trades both) and does NOT fire when each key condition is missing;
- update the strategy count in the tests (`STRATEGIES.length`) and check what the default Top 15
  alerts on (`topFifteen`, `priority`, the `DEFAULT_*` lists);
- keep `tests/audit.test.mjs` passing - it is the guard on the rules below.
- per-strategy filters (`STRATEGY_FILTERS`, the scanner's Filters button): a filter's DEFAULT must be
  the rule as written and tested (an untouched strategy behaves exactly as before); read them through
  `strategyFilters(id, input.filters?.[id])`, and test that loosening each one lets its case through;
- every strategy also has the TRADE filters (`TRADE_FILTERS`: sides, entry window, stop / target size, time stop,
  trailing stop), applied by `applyTradeFilter` - defaults change nothing. The strategy tuning (`strategyTuning.js`,
  `scanDay.js`, `scanner-runner/tune.mjs`, the Strategy tuning page) measures settings through the same function and
  the same day scan as the scanner; keep `tests/strategy-tuning.test.mjs` (tuning == scanner) passing;
- a strategy that measures as losing is RETIRED (`retired: true` in `STRATEGIES`), not deleted: it is
  not run, listed, alerted or scored (`ACTIVE_STRATEGIES`); tests can still run it with `includeRetired`.

### Rules the scanner must keep (checked by `tests/audit.test.mjs`)

- **No look-ahead.** A setup at clock T uses only what was known at T: completed minute bars, prints
  up to T, and OI / premiums / spot / futures of FINISHED minutes. OI-replay points are 1-minute bars
  stamped at their start but holding their close, so a replayed day's context is built with
  `buildOiContext(run, expiry, { live: false })` (points read at their minute's end); only today's live
  context (`live: true`, ticks folded into the running minute) reads the running minute.
- **Entry** = the futures price at the clock: the last tape print, else the last completed minute's
  close (`replayView` / `priceAt`) - never the last big print or volume-spike minute.
- **Outcome** (`simulateOutcome`): bars from the one starting at the entry (a bar already running at a
  mid-minute live entry is skipped); stop before target in the same bar; a bar opening beyond the stop
  fills at its open; target at the target; the trailing stop moves after each completed bar and only
  tightens; time stop and the 15:10 square-off at the bar's close; no entries after 14:45.
- **Option trades**: entry premium = the last finished minute's; their own Max SL / Target are checked
  from the first full minute after the entry, at the level; a SL / target / trail change applies to
  open trades only, FROM the minute it is made (`levelLog` on the position, `trailLog` for the futures
  signals' trailing SL; `optionStopTargetHit` / `simulateOutcome` follow them - what already passed is
  never rewritten and a trailing stop is never loosened by a change); paper trades are all sized by the current lots setting (live trades keep their quantity).

## Other rules

- OI Replay's TODAY comes from the server's memory, not Dhan, after one backfill per series per day: the live feed
  (`OiReplayLiveFeedService`) keeps every tracked index's option legs and near futures as 1-minute bars
  (`LiveOptionLegStore`, all day, page open or not), spot is the spot feed's own day (`SpotFeedHostedService`), and
  `OiReplayService` joins the one backfill (`TodayFetchShare`) to the feed's bars since (`MergeTodayLive`) - so
  switching index on the live page asks Dhan nothing. The page's Clear cache drops it (`refresh=true`).
  `TodayWarmupService` keeps every index ready before anyone switches: in market hours, every 5 minutes, it asks each
  index's live run and Order Flow backfill (Dhan once a day, memory after; a restart is ready again within one pass).
  The Order Flow page's live engines already run all three indices' near futures all day (`OrderFlowService`).
- Every PAST day of the Dhan Data API (intraday spot / futures / option candles, the rolling / expired-option chain - NIFTY,
  BANKNIFTY, SENSEX alike) is kept on disk by `DhanDataCache` (`Storage:DhanCachePath`, the persistent volume in
  docker-compose), ONE FILE PER INSTRUMENT AND DAY (`DhanDayWindow`): any window reads the days kept from disk and asks Dhan
  for the rest in one call - so a window running into today (the chart backfills) still keeps its past days. A day is kept
  when it is before today and Dhan sent a full session of it (its own timestamps - a thin option strike's untraded minutes
  come at a 0 price the parser drops, and still count, or BANKNIFTY's monthly strikes were never kept) or a later past day
  in the same answer (a holiday is then kept empty, a short session short); today, empty answers and a half LAST day go to
  Dhan again. Older whole-window files are still read for their exact request and split into days. The folder is held to
  `Storage:DhanCacheMaxGb` (10 GB): over it, the files read least recently go first (`TrimNow`). A new Dhan data call for
  past days goes through `DhanHistoricalDataService` / `DhanRollingOptionDataService` so it is cached too
  (`DhanDataCacheTests.cs`). EVERY Dhan REST call goes through `DhanApiClient`'s Polly pipeline (stale-token retry -> chart
  "too many requests" retry, never an order -> rate limiter -> a data call's 20 s timeout from when it is SENT), whose rate
  limiter is the ONE shared `DhanRestRateLimiter` (each attempt, retries included): Dhan's limits are per account and per
  category - orders 10/s, 250/min, 1000/h, 7000/day (.NET sliding windows; one past the minute / hour / day limit is refused,
  not held), data 5/s (`DhanDataApiRateLimiter`: evenly spaced, page loads first), quotes 1/s, the rest 20/s
  (`DhanDataApiSharedLimitTests.cs`). Never call Dhan's REST API around `DhanApiClient`. No loops of a failing request (Dhan
  support flagged them): failures are NOT cached - every call goes to Dhan - but a background timer whose Dhan call failed
  slows down (`RetryBackoff` / `KeyedBackoff`: today warm-up and spot volume 10 min doubling to 1 h, CDV 30 s doubling to
  30 min) instead of asking again at its normal pace; any new timer that calls Dhan must do the same
  (`DhanRepeatGuardTests.cs`). NOTHING polls Dhan outside market hours - IST weekdays 09:00 - 16:00 (`MarketHours`): every
  hosted service's loop runs in `MarketHours.BackgroundScope()`, as do the server scanner's requests and a page's TIMER
  refreshes (the `X-Poll` header - `POLL_HEADERS` in `shared.jsx`), and `DhanApiClient` does not send a background polling
  call (positions, orders, the option chain / OI, quotes - everything but `/charts/...`) outside the window; the positions /
  orders refresh and the kill switch check also skip their rounds (`MarketHours.IsOpen`). Candle backfills (`/charts/...`)
  are not polling and go at any hour, as do a page's first load or a click; token renewal has its own HttpClient. A new hosted service or page timer must do the same (`MarketHoursTests.cs`). What reached Dhan in the last 15 min: `GET /api/system/dhan-calls` (admin). `GET /api/oi-replay/{u}/run?forceFetch=true` (the OI Replay page's "Force fetch from Dhan" tick) skips the saved days -
  the cache's reads miss (`DhanDataCache.ForceRefreshScope`), the stored database and the in-memory futures are not used - and writes what Dhan sends over the cache.
  What NSE answers for a PAST day (the contract list - `NseFuturesContractArchive` - and an expired contract's 1-minute bars - `NseChartHistory`) is kept on
  disk too (`NseDayStore`, `{DhanCachePath}/nse`), and after NSE does not answer it is not asked again for 10 minutes (`NseBackoff`) - callers fall back at once
  instead of waiting out a 20 - 30 s timeout per request. Dhan's scrip master is ONE kept file shared by the spot / futures / option-chain masters
  (`DhanScripMasterFile`, `{DhanCachePath}/scrip-master`, re-downloaded after 4 h; a failed download uses the copy kept) - not three downloads after every start.

- Charts show MARKET HOURS only - the F&O session, weekdays 09:15 - 15:30 IST (15:29 the last minute): after the close
  Dhan keeps re-sending snapshots and the book. Server: `MarketHours.InTradingSession` - the OI Replay live feed keeps no
  bar / sends no chart tick outside it (only each leg's last reading), the Order Flow engine takes no heatmap column, the
  spot feed (`SpotUnderlyingState.ApplyTick`) builds no spot candle / volume outside it (the last price still follows the
  index; the first tick after the close ends the 15:29 bar, so `spotUpdate` then carries no forming bar).
  Page: `marketSession.js` - `groupByStrike` (every OI chart, heatmap, totals, walls, the External page),
  `mergeFuturesLive`, and the OI Replay / External spot candles and VWAP (loaded and live) drop readings outside it. A new
  chart feed must do the same (`tests/market-session.test.mjs`, `SpotUnderlyingStateTests.cs`).

- Never commit local-only auth bypasses, credentials or `appsettings.Local.json`; never change Dhan
  credentials. Don't run the real server against Dhan just to test - use the tests, `vite preview` with
  a mocked `/api`, or a local feeder.
- The External account (`AuthRoles.External`, `Auth:ExternalEmail` / `Auth:ExternalPasswordHash` - a PBKDF2 hash, never the
  plain password) sees only `ExternalPage.jsx` (tabs: OI Replay's CE / PE / Net OI totals, the Order Flow liquidity heatmap with
  big-order dots, OI Replay's spot chart with its timeframe, VWAP and OI S-R walls ("Top 5" off by default, "Δ and S-R only" short labels on by default), OI Replay's
  chain-wide CE / PE OI with its Total / Since open switch - those pages' own exported components
  and code, not copies) and reaches only `/api/external/...`
  (`ExternalController`, NIFTY / BANKNIFTY, read-only, today - or, for the OI and chart, one of the last 5 trading days, `?date=`, allowed list from `days`), `/api/auth/...` and `/hubs/spot`, where it may join only
  "of:{U}", "of:{U}:{expiry}", "c:{U}:N1" and "u:{U}" (`ExternalAccess.MayJoin`); what used to go to every hub connection goes to
  `SpotHub.StaffGroup`, which it never joins. `ExternalAccess` answers 403 to every other API, hub and swagger for it, deny by
  default (`ExternalAccessTests.cs` checks every controller and that nothing is sent to Clients.All). Never widen it.
- The OI totals S/R break and 🎯 high-probability alerts (`oiLevelBreaks.js`) run in TWO places with ONE step
  (`stepOiBreakAlerts`): the OI Replay page while it is open (pop-up, chime, voice) and the server scanner for every enabled
  index with no page open (`IndexScanner.checkOiBreaks`, Telegram tagged [Server]). 🎯 = a cumulative-line break AND the CE or PE
  OI at ATM ± 1 shifting `atmShiftPct` % (default 20) of its size the same way, within the window. Settings (on / window / %) are
  `config.oiBreakAlerts`, shown and saved by the page; the Telegram keys are the same (`breakAlertKey` /
  `highProbabilityAlertKey`), so a message goes once; the page sends Telegram itself only when the server is not covering
  the index. `tests/oi-break-alerts-server.test.mjs` / `tests/oi-level-breaks.test.mjs`.
- OI Replay's ATM straddle card (`StraddleCard.jsx`, `straddle.js`): the call + put at the strike nearest spot from a set
  time (09:21 by default, the card's "From"), its VWAP, the range the options priced then (strike ± straddle), the straddle
  re-centred after spot moves N strikes ("Re-centre after") and read again from there, ATM IV, and the read (sideways /
  premium bought / trend / breakout / not confirmed) over "Read over" minutes. It runs on the replay clock (nothing after it -
  `tests/straddle.test.mjs`) and live; the read is a description of the day, not a measured signal - it feeds no strategy.
- The visitor log (admin-only Visitors page, `GET /api/system/visitors`): every page a browser opens - every account and
  visitors with no account (the login screen, `POST /api/auth/visit` from `visits.js`) - plus sign-ins, failed sign-ins and
  sign-outs, with the city / region / country of the connection (`VisitorLog`, `VisitRecorder`, one CSV file per IST day -
  `{yyyy-MM-dd}.csv`, a header row, formula-safe cells - under `Storage:VisitorLogPath`, 90 days; the page's Download CSV is
  `GET /api/system/visitors.csv`, admin only; Clear history is `DELETE /api/system/visitors`, admin only - it leaves one "cleared"
  entry naming who cleared it). NEVER store or show an IP address: `ClientAddress` gives the address only for the
  lookup (`GeoLocator` - DB-IP's free city database kept on this server under `Storage:GeoDbPath`, refreshed monthly by
  `GeoDbUpdater`, so addresses are never sent to any service) and the beacon's rate limit; `VisitorLogTests.cs` checks no address
  reaches the file.
- Live order placement only ever happens behind the explicit, confirmed "Auto-place on alert" switch in
  Live (Dhan) mode; alerts and the default auto trade are paper.
